            <p>
              Customer experience is many things, but it can broadly be
              described as the perception a customer or a B2B company has of a
              brand. These perceptions can lead to life-long loyalty to a brand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Imagine you’re a business looking to place beverage vending
              machines in your offices. The beverage retailer can offer you a
              one-size-fits-all experience, such as showing you pictures of
              various beverage displays. But a better approach would be to use
              augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) to create a
              <a href="/"> bespoke, personalized and customized experience </a>{" "}
              so that you can see exactly how each type of machine would look in
              your office space. Because of this great customer experience, you
              and your business colleagues are happy, and your business will use
              the same retailer next time you want a vending machine.

              With so much at stake, brands need to ask: is great CX enough to
              meet customer expectations and elicit positive emotions?​

          This evolution from CX is called the Business of Experience (BX)
        </h3>
        <p className="secSevenpara">
          In many ways, BX is the inevitable consequence of the fact that we had
          been defining the domain of customer-centricity too narrowly as a set
          of touch points over the past 20 years. Now, customer-centricity needs
          to be the driving force throughout an entire company in ways that most
          organizations have yet to embrace.
        </p>
        <p className="secSevenpara">
          And while embracing BX is the future of business, it’s still important
          for us to have an understanding of what CX is in order to thrive in
          the coming years
        </p>
        <h3 className="secSevenNormalHead">Every interaction is important</h3>
        <p className="secSevenpara">
          It’s vital that brands remember that every interaction people and
          businesses have with them elicits some sort of emotion. Whether good,
          bad, happy or sad, the feelings people experience are then associated
          with that brand. This can result in your customer asking some
          all-important questions: To buy or not to buy? To love or not to love?
          To return or not return?
        </p>
        <p className="secSevenpara">
          Brands who want to increase customer acquisition, customer loyalty,
          customer engagement and drive growth need to think about delivering
          more exceptional experiences. With so much at stake, brands need to
          ask: is great CX enough to meet customer expectations and elicit
          positive emotions?
